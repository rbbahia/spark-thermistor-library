spark-thermistor-library
========================

About
-----
A simple class for calculating temperature from simple 10K negative temperature
coefficient (NTC) thermistors.

This library is adapted from [Arduino Playground Thermistor2](http://playground.arduino.cc/ComponentLib/Thermistor2#TheSimpleCode) and packaged as a library for the Spark Core web IDE.


What You Need
-------------

 - A 10K NTC thermistor (initially tested with [this one](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/250)
 - A resistor (a 10,000 ohm resistor is used in the example)
 - A couple of wires
 - A Spark Core


How To Use
----------

 - Connect one lead of the thermistor to  VCC.
 - Connect one lead of the resistor to ground and the other lead to the thermistor.
 - Connect a wire from the ground/resistor lead of the thermistor to your desired analog pin.
